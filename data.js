In fact, Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates, said energy is his "top conviction call" right now. He predicts that crude oil prices will surge again in the spring as seasonal demand returns. "I think Russia is the big wild card at this moment," he told CNBC\'s " Street Signs Asia " on Friday, adding that much of the uncertainty comes from geopolitical and weather risks. "A very cold winter could disrupt Russian crude oil production and Black Sea ports have been hampered by storms," Navellier said. Furthermore, he said, Russia\'s exports have fallen to a three-month low as a result of "wild weather" in the Caspian Sea. "The proxy war in the Middle East, plus Venezuela\'s threat to seize two-thirds of Guyana are other wild cards that could impact crude oil prices," he added.

In a Dec. 7 note, Citi noted that global oil and gas prices have deflated almost 30% this year, but also highlighted oil\'s defensive qualities, such as lower debt than the rest of the market. "The sector enters 2024 with just one-third the level of leverage of the broad equity market, a relative advantage that the group has not held since the heady oil price days of 2007/08," it said. Because of that, the oil sector is able to use balance sheet strength to protect shareholder distributions, while other sectors face the prospect of refinancing at a significantly higher cost, Citi noted. Citi named two buy-rated energy companies: British oil and gas firm BP and ConocoPhillips. It said that "there is still more left in the trade" given that its valuation is "two-turns" cheaper than its large-cap U.S. peers. Citi also pointed to its potential for growth — underpinned by its shale business — which can outpace that of its peers by the end of the decade. It said BP\'s appointment of a new CEO looks to be a "potential equity catalyst." BP, in "offering both benchmark exposure and a credible New Energy story ... can attract capital," Citi wrote. JPMorgan, for its part, said in its 2024 commodities outlook that it\'s tactically bullish on oil and gas. "We see value in energy—both oil and gas—though timing an entry and exit will continue to be critical," it said. "Steady demand growth should push prices of key commodities, like oil, higher off current spot levels in 2024, with carry adding further to returns," the bank added.

        "In a culinary odyssey spanning seven years, McDonald’s, the iconic fast-food giant, has undertaken a monumental task – the complete overhaul of its legendary burgers. This strategic initiative comes at a time of heightened competition in the fast-food industry, where the quest for burger supremacy has reached a fever pitch. McDonald’s, known for its golden arches and beloved classics, is not resting on its laurels but is instead rewriting the script for its signature offering.\n\nThe transformation of these burgers is more than a mere cosmetic makeover; it is a carefully orchestrated symphony of flavors, textures, and innovation. Each component, from the quality of the ingredients to the meticulous crafting of the recipes, has been subjected to scrutiny and enhancement. The result is not just a burger but a culinary masterpiece that reflects McDonald’s commitment to staying relevant and exceeding customer expectations.\n\nThe journey began with an understanding that the fast-food landscape is evolving. Consumer preferences are shifting towards healthier options, premium ingredients, and sustainable practices. In response, McDonald’s has embraced this change head-on, infusing its burgers with a fresh perspective and contemporary flair. The revitalized menu is a fusion of time-honored favorites and exciting newcomers, a balance that caters to both loyal patrons and those seeking a novel gastronomic experience.\n\nBehind the scenes, culinary experts, food scientists, and chefs collaborated tirelessly to perfect each element of the burger. From sourcing high-quality, sustainable ingredients to fine-tuning cooking techniques, every detail was examined. The result is a burger that not only satisfies the taste buds but also aligns with modern dietary preferences and ethical considerations.\n\nAs the fast-food landscape evolves, McDonald’s recognizes the importance of setting new standards. The revitalized burgers symbolize the brand's dedication to culinary innovation and customer satisfaction. It's not just about competing; it's about leading the charge in defining what a fast-food experience should be in the 21st century.\n\nCustomers can now savor the fruits of this labor – a burger that transcends expectations, offering a symphony of flavors, a celebration of quality, and a nod to the future of fast food. McDonald’s, with its revitalized burger lineup, invites patrons on a gastronomic journey that goes beyond tradition, redefining the very essence of a fast-food classic.",

        "In a strategic move that could reshape the retail landscape, an investor group comprising Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital has launched a bold $5.8 billion buyout bid for the iconic retailer, Macy’s. The proposal, pitched at $21 per share, aims to take Macy’s private as it faces growing challenges from the fierce competition of online retail giants.\n\nMacy’s, a venerable department-store chain with a rich history, has been navigating a shifting retail environment, with online rivals exerting substantial pressure on its market value. The investor group's offer comes as a response to the significant impact of online competitors, seeking to provide Macy’s with the flexibility and strategic focus required to thrive in the ever-evolving retail landscape.\n\nThe $5.8 billion bid is not merely a financial transaction; it represents a strategic move to revitalize Macy’s and position it for sustained success in the highly competitive retail sector. By taking the company private, the investor group aims to shield Macy’s from the quarterly pressures of public markets, allowing for a more long-term and strategic approach to business decisions.\n\nArkhouse Management and Brigade Capital, known for their astute investment strategies, have meticulously crafted this proposal to ensure that Macy’s can regain its footing and explore innovative avenues without the scrutiny of public shareholders. The $21 per share offer reflects a premium valuation, acknowledging the inherent value and potential of Macy’s in a more controlled and focused operating environment.\n\nThis proposed buyout bid is a testament to the confidence that the investor group places in Macy’s as a brand and a business. It signals a belief that, under private ownership, Macy’s can undergo a transformative journey, leveraging its storied legacy and adapting to the dynamic retail landscape.\n\nAs this acquisition proposal unfolds, it opens a new chapter for Macy’s, one where it can potentially reinvent itself, adapt to changing consumer trends, and emerge as a more agile and resilient player in the retail industry. The outcome of this bid could reshape the future of Macy’s and influence the broader narrative of traditional retailers in the face of digital disruption.",

      title: "The Challenge Facing Companies When Dealing With LGBTQ Issues",

        "Most consumers want brands to support inclusion. But when they do, they face a potentially negative backlash. Just ask Bud Light.",

      content:
        "In the ever-evolving landscape of corporate responsibility, the challenge of navigating LGBTQ issues has become increasingly complex for companies. While most consumers express a desire for brands to actively support inclusion and diversity, the reality is that such endorsements can sometimes trigger unexpected and potentially negative reactions, as seen in the case of Bud Light and several other companies in 2023.\n\nThe headlines of 2023 suggest a landscape where companies, despite their best intentions, faced significant social-media backlash and, in some instances, boycotts over their visible support for LGBTQ causes. The dichotomy between consumer expectations and the actual response on social platforms highlights the delicate balance that companies must strike when engaging with LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe Bud Light incident serves as a poignant example. As the brand sought to express support for the LGBTQ community, it found itself at the center of a social-media storm, facing criticism and calls for boycotts. This scenario raises important questions about the motivations behind such backlash and the challenges companies encounter when attempting to align with societal values.\n\nOne key aspect is the diverse and often polarized nature of public opinion. While a significant portion of consumers welcomes and appreciates corporate support for LGBTQ causes, there exists a segment that vehemently opposes it. Negotiating this divide requires a nuanced approach that considers the varied perspectives within the consumer base.\n\nMoreover, the Bud Light case underscores the need for companies to communicate their commitment to inclusion authentically and transparently. The public is increasingly discerning and expects sincerity in corporate actions related to social issues. Inauthentic attempts or perceived tokenism can lead to swift and negative reactions.\n\nAs companies grapple with these challenges, there is an opportunity for genuine dialogue and understanding. Successfully navigating LGBTQ issues involves more than a symbolic display of support; it requires a commitment to fostering inclusivity within the organization and an ongoing effort to educate and engage with stakeholders.\n\nWhile the road may be fraught with challenges, it is essential for companies to recognize the importance of supporting LGBTQ issues authentically and to approach these endeavors with a sensitivity that reflects the diverse perspectives of their consumer base. The lessons learned from the experiences of 2023 can serve as a guide for companies seeking to contribute positively to the ongoing conversation around LGBTQ inclusion in the years to come.",

The decision to forgo the merger highlights the nuanced nature of deal-making in the industry.
